# climatic_report (climate 2011-2016-2020)

### To create a virtualenv in python3 :
`git init`\
`git clone https://github.com/TLRKiliann/web-scrap.git`\
`virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 web-scrap`\
`source web-scrap/bin/activate`\
`cd web-scrap`

---

### I've used beautifulsoup and requests :
`pip3 install beautifulsoup4`\
`pip3 install requests`

---

### Launch the application with the following command :
`python3 climate_board.py`

---

### Thus, you can see the different years (2011-2016-2020)!

> The weather conditions are precisely based on the city of Lausanne (CH).
